The Reen University Portal is an API that  aims to revolutionize administrative tasks within educational institutions. 
By providing a comprehensive solution, we strive to simplify processes for both students and staff members. With this portal, students can easily check their admission status, register for courses, and access important information. Staff members can efficiently manage admissions, create new faculties and departments, and oversee course management.
